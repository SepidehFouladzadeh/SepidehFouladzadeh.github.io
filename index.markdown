A Bioengineer in progress with a background in Mechanical Engineering (Control and Dynamical Systems). Navigating some of the biggest transitions—across borders and across disciplines. 
Interested in the intersection of dynamical systems, computation, and biology, and passionate about finding connections between seemingly different domains.

Ever exploring, learning, and staying open to what’s next—building community along the way.
